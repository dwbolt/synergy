    <h3>Stephanie Dotson</h3><p>Ocean Love Handmade Jewelry and Art by Demetrious combine, sharing a booth as usual in craft festivals. Art of the husband and wife team, Jeremy Demetrious Dotson does Lichtenberg woodburning, which looks like lightning, as the high voltage electricity creates a unique pattern on the wood. Jeremy also has been capturing and preserving real spiderwebs.  These create a unique gift for home decoration. Stephanie, who has enjoyed making jewelry for several years, recently got into making it with shells, gemstones, and freshwater pearls, after a recent trip to the beach. She has also experimented with drying mini mushrooms and pressed flowers, preserved in resin necklaces. She has also taken her love of plants to the extreme,  creating mini gnome fairy gardens with moss or succulent plants, adorned with handmade gnomes, mushrooms, butterflies, flowers, and fairy lanterns.</p>
